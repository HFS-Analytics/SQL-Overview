In the previous lesson, we discussed some basic query clauses that obtain results on an observation-by-observation basis. However, sometimes we will want to know information at the level of a group, such as the highest, lowest, or average value among a set of observations or members. These types of questions are addressed using aggregate functions, which compute a representative value for a defined group of cases.

For example, let's talk about dogs.

*Pictured: One very large dog, one very small dog, and a human (not a dog)*

Consider the question "How big is a dog?" - Here we could be asking one of two questions:
- How big is one particular dog (e.g., Fido)
- How big are dogs in general?

These two questions are distinct, but their answers can inform each other. If I say that Fido weighs 40 pounds, that may sound like a lot to you, or it may sound like not very much. We would need information about the **typical** weights for dogs to know how Fido compares. If we say that dogs, on average, weigh about 38 pounds, then 40 lb Fido is not terribly unusual.

On the other hand, some breeds of dogs are larger than others, and there is variation within each breed. If Fido is a chihuahua, then 40 pounds is surprisingly large. If, however, he is a Great Dane, then 40 pounds would place him at the small end of the scale.

# Aggregate Functions

SQL offers a handful of standard aggregate functions as follows:

|Function | Description |
|:--- | :--- |
|AVG | Gets the average (artithmetic mean value) |
|COUNT | Gets the number of observations in each group |
|MAX | Gets the highest value for the group |
|MIN | Gets the lowest value for the group |
|VAR, STDEV | Give measures of dispersment, or how closely cases tend to stay close to the average |
|SUM | Gets the total by adding all values together |

In our database of dogs, we could find out how much our dogs weigh on average like so:

```sql
SELECT
AVG(DOGS.WEIGHT)
FROM DOGS
```

Which should return


|AVG(WEIGHT)|
|:---:|
|38.88843|

Or just shy of 39 pounds on average. If we wanted to also know how much all our dogs weighed combined (e.g., if we wanted to try to fit them all in an elevator), we could use:

```sql
SELECT
AVG(DOGS.WEIGHT),
SUM(DOGS.WEIGHT)
FROM DOGS
```

to get


|AVG(WEIGHT)| SUM(WEIGHT)|
|:---:|:---:|
|38.88843    |    9411|

At more than 9000 lb, fitting these dogs in the elevator outside my office is a bad idea on many levels.

# GROUP BY
So far, we have discussed aggregates that cover the entire sample, which is not always a terribly interesting result. Often, we want to know how different groups or sub-groups compare in relation to each other. To do this, we can define groupings based on certain attributes listed in a `GROUP BY` clause.

For example if we wanted to know how many male dogs we have versus females, we could write:

```sql
SELECT
DOGS.SEX,
COUNT(*)
FROM DOGS
GROUP BY DOGS.SEX
```

|Sex | COUNT(\*)|
|:---:|:---:|
| Female   |   121|
|   Male   |   121|

Here we used a `*` in the `COUNT` function because we do not particularly care what column gets counted, but we could also pass it the name of a specific column if we want to count non-null values.

We can also group by multiple values and get counts (or other aggregates) for all present combinations of those values. For example, we might want to know how many male and female dogs we have, and how many of each where already fixed when they came into the shelter (`FIXED_AT_INTAKE = 1`) or not yet fixed (`FIXED_AT_INTAKE = 0`). Often, we would display this as a cross-tabulation like so:

||  **Male** | **Female** |
|:--- | :---: | :---:|
|**Already Fixed** | # of Fixed Males | # of Fixed Females |
|**Not Yet Fixed** | # of Un-Fixed Males | # of Un-Fixed Females | 

The query to get these values looks like this:

```sql
SELECT
DOGS.SEX,
DOGS.FIXED_AT_INTAKE,
COUNT(*)
FROM DOGS
GROUP BY DOGS.SEX, DOGS.FIXED_AT_INTAKE
```

and the result looks like this, with each cell expressed as a row:

|    SEX |FIXED_AT_INTAKE |COUNT(\*)
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Female |              0 |     121
|   Male |              0 |      97
|   Male |              1 |      24

Now, you may wonder: why are there only three rows, but the table had four cells (two sexes \* two fixed statuses)? Recall from earlier, that `GROUP BY` will give 
>  counts (or other aggregates) for all present combinations of those values

If there were no female dogs who were fixed at the time of intake, then that cell in the cross-table would have a 0 for its count. Because the query did not find any female dogs who were fixed at intake, those (hypothetical) dogs were not *present* to be included in the count.

||  **Male** | **Female** |
|:--- | :---: | :---:|
|**Already Fixed** | 24 | 0 |
|**Not Yet Fixed** | 97 | 121 | 

*Note:* In a `SELECT` statement containing an aggregate function, any columns that are **not** aggregate calculations need to be referenced in the `GROUP BY` clause.

```sql
SELECT
DOGS.SEX,
COUNT(*)
FROM DOGS
```

will result in an eror message, and the un-aggregated column (`SEX`) will need to be added to a `GROUP BY` clause. On the other hand, apparently it is permissible to include a column in `GROUP BY` without referencing it in `SELECT`, but this may not be useful, because we will have separated aggregates without any indication which groups these counts belong to!

# HAVING

The `WHERE` clause filters out specific *rows* from the result set. Similarly, the `HAVING` clause can filter out *groups* based on aggregate values. For example, suppose we wanted to get a list of small dog breeds, defined as breeds in which no dog has a weight more than 10 pounds. We could phrase this request as:

```sql
SELECT 
Breeds.Breed_Name, 
MAX(Dogs.Weight) 
FROM Breeds 
INNER JOIN Dogs ON Breeds.Breed_ID = Dogs.Breed_ID 
GROUP BY Breed_Name 
HAVING MAX(Dogs.Weight) <= 10
```

to get:

|                 Breed_Name |MAX(Dogs.Weight)|
| :--- | ---:|
|              Affenpinschers|               10|
|           Brussels Griffons|               10|
|             Chinese Crested|               10|
|        English Toy Spaniels|               10|
|               Japanese Chin|               10|
|         Miniature Pinschers|                9|
|                   Papillons|                5|
|                 Pomeranians|                5|
| Portuguese Podengo Pequenos|               10|

If we are willing to take it on faith that all members of each breed weigh 10 lb or less, we could choose to leave the `MAX(Weight)` calculation out of the `SELECT` clause (keeping it only in the `HAVING` clause) and only getting a list of breeds.

# Using WHERE with Aggregates
It is good to note that the `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses are applied after the `WHERE` clause. Consequently, we can exclude individual cases before aggregates are computed. For example, we can get the maximum, minimum, and average weight for all dogs who are more than 75 pounds:

```sql
SELECT
BREED_NAME,
MAX(WEIGHT),
MIN(WEIGHT),
AVG(WEIGHT)
FROM DOGS 
INNER JOIN BREEDS ON DOGS.BREED_ID = BREEDS.BREED_ID
WHERE WEIGHT > 75
GROUP BY BREED_NAME
```

|           Breed_Name|MAX(WEIGHT)| MIN(WEIGHT)| AVG(WEIGHT)|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| German Shepherd Dogs|         78|          78|          78|
|           Retrievers|         78|          78|          78|
|              Setters|         76|          76|          76|
|             Spaniels|         81|          81|          81|
|          Weimaraners|         83|          83|          83|

# Using OVER to Compare Individuals to Aggregates

Going back to our original example, if we know a given dog's weight and only want to (mentally) compare that weight against an average for all dogs or dogs of a particular breed, then using `GROUP BY` should be sufficient. However, if we want to compare all records to a relevant aggregate value, a different approach may be in order. 

As a review, the following query will get us each dog, its breed, and its weight.

```sql
SELECT TOP 5
Dogs.Dog_Name,
Breeds.Breed_Name,
Dogs.Weight
FROM Dogs
INNER JOIN Breeds on Dogs.Breed_ID = Breeds.Breed_ID
```

It may be tempting to simply add a column for the average weight, grouped by breed:

```sql
SELECT TOP 5
Dogs.Dog_Name,
Breeds.Breed_Name,
Dogs.Weight,
AVG(Dogs.Weight) as Average_Weight_for_Breed
FROM Dogs
INNER JOIN Breeds on Dogs.Breed_ID = Breeds.Breed_ID
GROUP BY Breeds.Breed_Name
```

However, this query will either result in an error message along the lines of 

> 'Dogs.Weight' is invalid in the select list because it is not contained in either an aggregate function or the GROUP BY clause

or else you will get some strange result such as the result for only one dob per breed (depending on the exact implementation of SQL and the database being used).

Instead, we should use the `OVER` clause to modify the average calculation. `OVER` lets us apply an aggregate calculation on a row-by-row basis and to determine the scope of an aggregate - which other rows are to be included in each row's result. `OVER` takes up to three arguments: `PARTITION BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `ROWS BETWEEN`. `PARTITION BY` is the simplest and most common usage, and operates much like `GROUP BY` in that it determines the level of grouping for the calculation to reflect. Here, we `PARTITION BY` the breed names, so each dog is presented with its weight and the average weight for other dogs of the same breed.

```sql
SELECT TOP 5
Dogs.Dog_Name,
Dogs.Weight,
Breeds.Breed_Name,
AVG(Dogs.Weight)
  OVER (PARTITION BY Breeds.Breed_ID) as Average_Weight_for_Breed
FROM Dogs
INNER JOIN Breeds on Dogs.Breed_ID = Breeds.Breed_ID
```

|Dog_Name |Weight|                  Breed_Name| Average_Weight_for_Breed|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| CHARLIE |    10|              Affenpinschers|                     10.0|
|    ZEUS |    51|               Afghan Hounds|                     52.5|
|   ROMEO |    54|               Afghan Hounds|                     52.5|
|    REMY |    53|           Airedale Terriers|                     53.0|
|   STORM |    47| American English Coonhounds|                     51.0|

Note that Zeus and Romeo are both Afghan Hounds and are presented with their own individual weights and the averages for their breeds.

`ORDER BY` lets us control the ordering of the rows before the aggregate is calculated, which is useful for the `ROW_NUMBER` function. 

`ROWS BETWEEN` also depends on `ORDER BY` (it should not be used without setting an order) and lets us define which rows are to be included according to their location relative to the current row (using the keywords `PRECEEDING`, `FOLLOWING`, and `CURRENT ROW`). This is most useful in terms of rolling averages and running totals. For example, 

``` sql
SELECT
Dogs.Dog_Name,
Breeds.Breed_Name,
Dogs.Weight,
COUNT(Dogs.Dog_ID)
  OVER (PARTITION BY Breeds.Breed_ID ORDER BY Dogs.Weight DESC ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
FROM Dogs
INNER JOIN Breeds on Dogs.Breed_ID = Breeds.Breed_ID
``` 

might give us a ranking of dogs by weight within breeds (1 being the heaviest dog for its breed) by taking a running count of dogs per breed, and 

``` sql
SELECT
Dogs.Dog_Name,
Breeds.Breed_Name,
Dogs.Weight,
AVG(Dogs.Dog_ID)
  OVER (PARTITION BY Breeds.Breed_ID ORDER BY Dogs.Weight ASC ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING)
FROM Dogs
INNER JOIN Breeds on Dogs.Breed_ID = Breeds.Breed_ID
``` 

might give us the agerage weight for each dog, the next lightest, and the next heaviest (if there are any).
