# Joins and Relationships

Let's revisit our first table of very good dogs.

Dog_ID |Name | Sex | Coat | Has_Spots | Breed_ID
:---|:----| :----| :----| :----| :----
1|Snoopy | Male | White | Yes | 1
2|Scooby-Doo | Male | Brown | Yes | 2
3|Lassie | Female | Brown | No | 3
4|Benji | Male | Brown | No | 4
5|Perdita | Female | White | Yes | 5

Here I have made a small modification of moving the breeds to a separate table - now the Dog table contains a foreign key reference to Breed. This will make it more efficient to represent individual dogs who may have the same breed.

Breed_ID | Breed_Name
:--- | :---
1 | Beagle
2 | Great Dane 
3 | Border Collie
4 | Mixed
5 | Dalmatian

Because the Dog table now only contains a *reference* to the breed table, we need to join the two tables in a query to see the breed for each dog.

There are some things computers are not very good at: making inferences from context, enjoying a cool autumn afternoon, and appreciating a good pun among them. However, computers are very good at running through a large number of possible combinations on a short amount of time. When we execute a SQL query that joins two tables, one of the first things to happen is the database engine runs through possible combinations of values between the two tables. For illustration, here are the first five values of the possible combinations of Dog and Breed - mathematically known as a Cartesian product.

Dog_ID | Name | Breed_ID | Breed_Name
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
1 | Snoopy | 1 | Beagle
1 | Snoopy | 2 | Great Dane 
1 | Snoopy | 3 | Border Collie
1 | Snoopy | 4 | Mixed
1 | Snoopy | 5 | Dalmatian

Now, we know that not all these combinations are valid (Snoopy being a Beagle and only a Beagle), so a second step is to filter the result down to the combinations we know are appropriate by matching the foreign key for Breed_ID from the Dog table to the primary key in the Breed table.

Dog_ID |Name | Sex | Coat | Has_Spots | Breed_ID | Breed_Name
:---|:----| :----| :----| :----| :---- | :---
1|Snoopy | Male | White | Yes     | 1  | Beagle
2|Scooby-Doo | Male | Brown | Yes | 2  | Great Dane 
3|Lassie | Female | Brown |    No | 3  | Border Collie
4|Benji | Male | Brown | No       | 4  | Mixed
5|Perdita | Female | White | Yes  | 5  | Dalmatian

In SQL, this can be accomplished in two similar ways. The first explicitly states the Cartesian product (called here a `CROSS JOIN`):

```sql
SELECT
Dog.*
Breed.Breed_Name
FROM Dog
CROSS JOIN Breed
WHERE Dog.Breed_ID = Breed.Breed_ID
```

We will discuss the second approach (an `INNER JOIN`) in a little while.

For now, it is worth noting that we are not required to match rows based on equality; we can also match based on inequalities. For example, if we had an indicator of a dog's weight in the Dog table, we could create a query that matches each dog with another dog who is bigger, using something like `Dog.Weight < Larger_Dog.Weight`.

## Types of Relationships

All relationships between tables are considered in pairs of tables. Joining multiple tables therefore boils down to linking pairs of tables in a sequence. 

Relationships between tables can be described according to two axes (for a total of six types of relationship):
Is the relationship **mandatory** or **optional**?
- If mandatory, every entry in the first table *must* have a corresponding entry in the second table
- If optional, any entry in the first table may or may not have a corresponding entry in the second

Note that these requirements are not necessarily symmetrical. For example, suppose we had a table in our Good Dogs Database to track administration of heartworm medication. Every dose has to be associated with a dog, but some lucky pups do not have a heartworm infection and therefore never receive the medication.

Table relationships can also be described according to the maximum number of matches in each table:
- In a **one-to-one** relationship, an entry in the first table can only match one entry in the second table. For example, suppose we had a table listing each dog's favorite toy (we're assuming each dog has one favorite selected). Each toy belongs to one dog, and each dog has one favorite.
- In a **one-to-many** relationship, an entry in the first table can match multiple entries in the second. Going back to the medication example above, a dog may receive many doses of heartworm medication over its fluffy, joyful life (once every six months per label instructions).
- In a **many-to_many** relationship, each entry in the first table can associate with multiple records in the second table and each in the second with multiple records in the first. This is often reflected as a three-table pattern, like the Dogs-Dogs_Humans_Link-Humans example in Lesson 1.

## Types of Joins

Consider the following Venn Diagram.

![A Venn Diagram](Venn%20Diagram.png)

There are three common types of join operations between tables. The differences between these joins is in how they tolerate missing (NULL) values.
- *INNER JOIN* - Only records that match between the two tables are kept. If a record in either table has a null value for the join condition, that record is excluded from the result. This corresponds to Section B only of the Venn Diagram.
- *LEFT OUTER JOIN* - All records from the first table are kept. Records from the second table are included if they match the first table on the join criterion, otherwise a NULL indicates no match was found in the second table. This would correspond to Sections A + B in the Venn Diagram.
- *FULL OUTER JOIN* - All records from both tables are kept. If a record does not have a match in the other table, then a NULL indicates no match was found in the other table. This would correspond to Sections A + B + C in the Venn Diagram.

Observant readers may wonder why there is a "LEFT" join but not a "RIGHT" join. The answer is that right joins are sometimes supported, but they can also be performed by switching the order of the tables, e.g., `A RIGHT JOIN B` is equivalent to `B LEFT JOIN A`.
