First, let's define some terms:

Term | Definition
:-----|:-----
*Table*| a collection of data organized in rows and columns. Each table should represent a class of thing, or a linkage between two classes.
*Rows*| collection of values within a table reading left to right. Each row typically represents an observation or a thing.
*Columns*| collection of values within a table reading top to bottom. Each column represents an attribute or quality of an observation.
*Primary key*| an attribute or set of attributes in a table that uniquely identifies each row belonging to that table.
*Foreign key*| an attribute or set of attributes in a table that reference another table's primary key to determine a relationship between tables.
*View*| a saved or retrievable result of a query combining data from one or more tables.
*Query*| a stored set of instructions to collect data from one or more tables and combine into a single view of data.
*Relationship*| a rule based on a logical comparison that associates values in one table to values in another table.
*Join*| A component of a query that combines results from two tables based on a logical relationship between corresponding rows.

Each table should represent a discrete class of thing and the attributes that belong to that class. For example, let's talk about dogs.

What are some attributes we might consider in describing a dog? These should be qualities each member should have to some degree, but the actual quality varies between dogs. I might start with describing a dog by name, sex, coat color, whether or not it has spots, and breed.

Name | Sex | Coat | Has_Spots | Breed
:----| :----| :----| :----| :----
Snoopy | Male | White | Yes | Beagle
Scooby-Doo | Male | Brown | Yes | Great Dane
Lassie | Female | Brown | No | Border Collie
Benji | Male | Brown | No | Mixed
Perdita | Female | White | Yes | Dalmatian

Each table should represent one class of thing, and different types of things should be stored in different tables. For example, this would be a poorly-designed table:

Dog | Human
:---|:---
Snoopy | Charlie Brown
Scooby-Doo | Shaggy
 | Anakin Skywalker
 Alpha | Charles Muntz
 Dug | Charles Muntz
 Benji | 
 Perdita | Roger Radcliffe
 Perdita | Anita Radcliffe
 
 Note that not all dogs have associated humans, not all humans have dogs, some humans are associated with multiple dogs, and some dogs with multiple people. There are empty cells where there are not associations, and where there are multiple humans/dogs in a relationship, all those attributes would be duplicated. Furthermore, attributes associated with dogs would not necessarily apply to their humans (Charlie Brown is bald but Snoopy has a full coat)!
 
 We would do better to split this into multiple, related tables.
 
 If we assume each dog can belong to only one human (leaving out Perdita but including Charles Muntz's canine companions), then we would need a table for dogs and one for humans.
 
 ID | Dog | Human_ID
 :---|:---|:---
 1 |Snoopy | 1
 2 | Scooby-Doo | 2
 3 | Alpha | 4
 4 | Dug | 4
 5 | Benji | 
 6 | Perdita |

Here, ID is a primary key for the dog table (each dog gets a unique value) and Human_ID is a foreign key showing an association.

ID | Human
:---|:---
1 | Charlie Brown
2 | Shaggy
3 | Anakin Skywalker
4 | Charles Muntz
5 | Roger Radcliffe
6 | Anita Radcliffe

Note we left Perdita without a human companion. In an even better design, we could remove the Human_ID from the Dog table and move it to a third, Dog_Human_Link table

ID | Dog_ID | Human_ID
:---|:---|:---
1 | 1 | 1
2 | 2 | 2
3 | 3| 4
4 | 4| 4
5 | 6 | 5
6 | 6 | 6

Among the three tables, there would now be only dog attributes in the Dog table, human attributes in the Human table, and a list of which dogs go with which people in the Dog_Human_Link table. A properly written query would be able to fully recreate the original table of dogs and humans, so nothing is lost.

Not only does splitting out the data make things more orderly, it reduces the overall size of the database (making it easier to store more useful information and faster to retrieve it) and makes it easier to maintain the data over time.

For example, suppose Anakin Skywalker had three dogs. If we used one table for dogs and humans, there would be three rows with Anakin's name on it. If (for some reason) Anakin should change his name to Darth Vader, we would need to find and update all three of those rows, once for each dog. Instead, with a separate Human table, Anakin's name is updated *once* and any later query is able to reflect that change with no extra effort.

Using ID values to reference some attributes also saves space, especially if there is a fixed number of options for that value. For example, in myEvolv, there are many tables that reference the name of the agency responsible for a site, worker, or service.

Consider the name `Heartland Family Service`. Data on computers is measured in bytes (groups of four bits which each can be a 1 or 0). `Heartland Family Service` takes up 24 bytes (one per character). On the other hand, an integer usually takes up between 1 and 8 bytes (depending on the exact format), which can make for a 2/3 size reduction just by replacing that text with an ID number. myEvolv primarily uses GUIDs, which are basically 16-byte random numbers (which has a range from 0 to 2 ^ 128, which is really really big). Even large GUIDs would save 1/3 of the space of spelling out `Heartland Family Service` each time.
