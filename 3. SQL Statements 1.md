# The Query Structure

A SQL query is formatted in a statement which describes the shape and structure of the outputted data. Each statement will comprise clauses, which each convey a specifc aspect of the data requested. Here we will discuss the basic clauses of a SQL statement: SELECT, FROM, and WHERE. In the next lesson, we will discuss some further clauses.

Suppose I wanted to bake a pie, and asked you to go find me a pumpkin, at the local pumpkin patch, that is ripe and at least 10 lb in weight. You go to the patch, but this late in the season there are only three left: 
* one is ripe, but only weighs 5 lb
* one weighs 12 lb, but is rotten
* the last is 10 lb exactly and perfectly ripe. 

You reject the first two, bring me the third, and we enjoy some delicious pie that evening.

Many SQL queries are phrased just like my request for a pumpkin. We specify the columns (or gourd) we want, where from (a set of tables or a pumpkin patch), and what criteria we will use to accept or reject each finding.

```SQL
SELECT pumpkin_id
FROM pumpkin_patch
WHERE is_ripe = 1 AND pumpkin_weight >= 10
```

## SELECT

## FROM

## WHERE
