# The Query Structure

A SQL query is formatted in a statement which describes the shape and structure of the outputted data. Each statement will comprise clauses, which each convey a specifc aspect of the data requested. Here we will discuss the basic clauses of a SQL statement: SELECT, FROM, and WHERE. In the next lesson, we will discuss some further clauses.

Suppose I wanted to bake a pie, and asked you to go find me a pumpkin, at the local pumpkin patch, that is ripe and at least 10 lb in weight. You go to the patch, but this late in the season there are only three left: 
* one is ripe, but only weighs 5 lb
* one weighs 12 lb, but is rotten
* the last is 10 lb exactly and perfectly ripe. 

You reject the first two, bring me the third, and we enjoy some delicious pie that evening.

Many SQL queries are phrased just like my request for a pumpkin. We specify the columns (or gourd) we want, where from (a set of tables or a pumpkin patch), and what criteria we will use to accept or reject each finding.

```SQL
SELECT pumpkin_id
FROM pumpkin_patch
WHERE is_ripe = 1 AND pumpkin_weight >= 10
```

From here, we will discuss in more detail how queries are phrased. Please note that SQL is **not** case-sensitive, but I will tend to capitalize keywords defined in the language as a convention. SQL also generally does not care about line breaks and a query can be written in a single line or across multiple lines. However, I will strive to use line breaks to emphasize the order and structure of each query.

## SELECT
In the select clause, we indicate which _columns_ from the result set we want to display. Commas will separate each column in the list, but common mistakes include omitting commas between columns and adding a comma after the last column.

For example, let's talk about dogs.

<details>
  <summary>
Happy Furbaby Shelter (HFS) is a non-profit, no-kill shelter finding homes for very good dogs since 1875. We have a list of very good dogs adopted from the shelter <a href = "https://github.com/HFS-Analytics/SQL-Overview/blob/main/Dogs.csv"> here</a>)
    </summary>
**Note:** These are fictional dogs generated from data provided by <a href = "https://akc.org"> the American Kennel Club</a>. Any resemblence to actual dogs, living or in Heaven, is completely coincidental.
  
</details>

Here are the first five rows for reference:

```sql
SELECT TOP 5
Dog_ID,
Dog_Name,
Sex,
Breed_ID,
Weight,
Age_at_Intake,
Fixed_at_Intake
From Dogs
```

Dog_ID|Dog_Name|Sex|Breed_ID|Weight|Age_at_Intake|Fixed_at_Intake
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
1|LUNA|Female|86|11|0|0
2|BELLA|Female|140|13|9|0
3|DAISY|Female|120|50|12|0
4|LUCY|Female|153|30|2|0
5|BAILEY|Female|174|41|6|0

The columns here represent:
* a unique ID number for each dog, 
* the dog's name, sex (male or female), 
* an ID number for the dog's breed, 
* a weight measurement (in pounds) collected at intake, 
* the dog's estimated age (in human years) at intake, and 
* an indicator for whether or not the dog was already spayed or neutered ("fixed") at the time of intake into the shelter (1 = yes, 0 = no)

Thw `TOP` keyword after select limits the result set to the first 5 records.

In a query, especially one drawing from multiple tables, we may come across columns we do not need in order to answer our current question or which provide us redundant information. Explicitly listing out the columns we want helps assure that the information we need does not get lost among the data we don't. *However, we have the option to pull in all columns from the result set using `SELECT *` or all columns from a particular table using `SELECT Table_Name.*`

Column specifications in the SELECT statement follow this pattern:
`TABLE_NAME.COLUMN_NAME AS ALIAS`

Including the column name helps ensure we get the correct column, especially when multiple tables contain a column with the same name. For example, both dogs and humans have names, but many humans will take offense if you call them by the dog's name (though most dogs don't seem to mind whose name you use).

An alias is a temporary name (only reflected in the output of the query) that we can assign to a column to make it easier to read or to recognize what it represents. This is particularly useful to distinguish multiple columns that have the same name within their respective tables, or to label the result of a calculation. Aliases only apply to the result, so if a column is referenced more than once or is referenced outside the `SELECT` clause, the alias will not be understood.

```sql
SELECT TOP 5
Name AS Pupper,
Breed_ID,
Age_at_Intake * 7 as Age_in_Dog_Years
FROM Dogs
```

Pupper|Breed_ID|Age_in_Dog_Years
:---:|:---:|:---:|
LUNA|86|0
BELLA|140|63
DAISY|120|84
LUCY|153|14
BAILEY|174|42

*Note:* The `AS` keyword is optional, and `Name AS Pupper` is equivalent to `Name Pupper`, but the former is easier to read. In the following query, we make the mistake of leaving out a comma between the two column names:

```sql
SELECT TOP 5
Dog_Name
Breed_ID
From Dogs
```

Breed_ID
:---:|
LUNA
BELLA
DAISY
LUCY
BAILEY

The result will be the contents of the `Name` column, but with an alias of `Breed_ID`, so be careful to place commas where appropriate.

### Calculations

We can also define new columns within the `SELECT` clause. 

**Constant values** (all rows have the same value within a query) are defined by typing the single value for the constant and assigning it an alias:

```sql
SELECT TOP 5
Dog_Name,
10 AS Goodness
From Dogs
```

Dog_Name|Goodness
:---:|:---:|
LUNA|10
BELLA|10
DAISY|10
LUCY|10
BAILEY|10

The above query will return each dog's name with a goodness rating of 10 for each (they are all good dogs, after all).

**Mathematical Operators** can be placed between two values to produce a result applied to each row of the result set, e.g.,

```sql
SELECT top 5
Dog_Name,
Age_at_Intake + Weight as Age_Weight
FROM Dogs
```

Dog_Name|Age_Weight
:---:|:---:
LUNA|11
BELLA|22
DAISY|62
LUCY|32
BAILEY|47

Operator | Use 
|:---:|:---
\+ | Addition
\- | Subtraction
\* | Multiplication
/ | Division

The addition operator (\+) can also be used to combine text:
```sql
SELECT
2 + 2 -- yields 4
"Bow" + "-" + "wow!" -- yields 'Bow-wow!'
```

**Branching logic:** `CASE` statements and the `IIF` function are useful for reflecting branching logic according to the value of one or more columns. The statement starts with `CASE`, ends with `END`, and between are pairs of logical conditions and output values. These tests are conducted in order and the first test to be true determines the result of the calculation. Both of these features rely on Boolean logic, which is described a little more fully under the `WHERE` section below.

 ```sql
 SELECT TOP 5
 Dog_Name,
 CASE
   WHEN Age <= 1 THEN 'Just a pup!'
   WHEN Age > 10 THEN 'A senior dog'
   ELSE 'A very good dog'
 END AS Age_Group
 FROM Dogs
  ```
  
Dog_Name|Age_Group
:---:|:---:
LUNA|Just a Pup!
BELLA|A very good dog
DAISY|A senior dog
LUCY|A very good dog
BAILEY|A very good dog
  
  `IIF` evaluates a test in the first argument, then returns the value of the second argument if true, or the second if false, e.g., `IIF(Sex = 'Female', 'A good girl!', 'A good dog!')`
  
*Note: Use single quotes `'` to mark text strings. Double quotes (`"`) are an alternative way to indicate a column name in some SQL dialects and can lead to unexpected results.*
  
SQL does not have a single data type that directly represents true or false values, so we will often use 1 and 0, respectively as the result of `CASE` or `IIF` when all we want is an indicator of whether or not a condition is true.

## FROM

In the `FROM` clause, we define the combination of data sources, the result set, we will use to get the information we want. The `FROM` clause will start with a single data source, also known as the 'driving table,' and will accumulate other data sources, usually through a series of `JOIN` operations, like a snowball.

*Pictured: A graphical representation of a complex query traversing many tables*

We discussed previously the `CROSS JOIN` operation, but the more common `JOIN`s are `INNER` and `LEFT OUTER JOIN`. These operations typically follow the pattern of:
```SQL 
TYPE OF JOIN TABLE_TO_ADD ON TABLE_IN_RESULT_SET.COLUMN_NAME = TABLE_TO_ADD.COLUMN_NAME
```

The `ON` portion tells the database how we want it to make a match. Usually we will join on a single, exact matching condition, but we can use multiple conditions or use an inequality to look for rows that qualify for inclusion based on a difference between the values; however, these latter two cases are also often easier to understand if part of the comparison is done in the `WHERE` clause.

`INNER JOIN`s will create a result set out of the rows that match between the current result set and the table to add. Any rows that do not have a match in either table are discarded.

`LEFT OUTER JOIN`s, on the other hand, will keep all rows in the current result set regardless of whether there is a match in the table to add, but will produce a `NULL` or missing value in place of data from the second table where there is no exact match.

Returning to our canine friends, we have a table of Dogs and we have a table of Breeds.

```SQL
SELECT TOP 5
Breed_Name
FROM Breeds
```

       Breed_Name     |
                :---:|
   Affenpinschers     |
    Afghan Hounds     |
    Afghan Hounds     |
Airedale Terriers     |
           Akitas     |

We can `JOIN` this table of Breeds to our table of Dogs to get a list of breeds with their doggie representatives (or, alternatively, dogs with their respective breeds). We suspect that we do not have every breed represented in our sample (an optional relationship), though, so we will start with a `LEFT OUTER JOIN`

```SQL
SELECT TOP 5
Breed_Name
FROM Breeds
LEFT OUTER JOIN Dogs on Breeds.Breed_ID = Dogs.Breed_ID
```

Breed_Name| Dog_Name
|:---:|:---:|
Affenpinschers  |CHARLIE
Afghan Hounds   | ROMEO
Afghan Hounds    | ZEUS
Airedale Terriers     |REMY
Akitas     ||
  
There were no Akitas in our sample of adopted dogs, so there is a blank in the place of a name for an Akita.

If we use an `INNER JOIN` instead:

```SQL
SELECT TOP 5
Breed_Name
FROM Breeds
INNER JOIN Dogs on Breeds.Breed_ID = Dogs.Breed_ID
```

Breed_Name| Dog_Name
|:---:|:---:
Affenpinschers  |CHARLIE
Afghan Hounds   | ROMEO
Afghan Hounds    | ZEUS
Airedale Terriers     |REMY
American English Coonhounds     |JACK
 
 The row for Akitas is left out because there was no matching row found.
 
 *Note* Two points of caution on outer joins of any flavor.
 1. Outer joins (left, right, or otherwise) tend to be slower than inner joins, because the database engine has to keep making two decisions (A: Do these rows match? B: Is the right hand side missing instead of a mismatch?) If a query runs slowly, reconsider whether you really want to see rows with missing values.
 2. Using an inner join after an outer join will remove rows without an exact match that the outer join had previously kept, because there ws not an exact match to the missing value in the later, inner, join. Therefore, using outer joins once often means committing to using them for all remaining tables in the `FROM` clause.

After adding one table to the result set, we can add any number of other tables to the result set by repeating the 
```SQL 
TYPE OF JOIN TABLE_TO_ADD ON TABLE_IN_RESULT_SET.COLUMN_NAME = TABLE_TO_ADD.COLUMN_NAME
```
pattern we discussed before. For example, we could get a list of all dogs, their breeds, and their complete histories with HFS using a query like:

```SQL
SELECT TOP 5
Dogs.Dog_Name,
Breeds.Breed_Name,
Events.Date,
Event_Types.Description
FROM Breeds
INNER JOIN Dogs on Breeds.Breed_ID = Dogs.Breed_ID
INNER JOIN Events on Dogs.Breed_ID = Events.Breed_ID
INNER JOIN Event_Types on Events.Event_Type_ID = Event_Types.Event_Type_ID
```

Dog_Name |     Breed_Name |       Date | Description|
:---:        |        :---:        |     :---:       | :---:             |
CHARLIE | Affenpinschers | 2021-12-30 |     Intake|
CHARLIE | Affenpinschers | 2022-08-16 |   Grooming|
CHARLIE | Affenpinschers | 2022-08-18 |   Adoption|
ZEUS |  Afghan Hounds | 2018-07-14 |     Intake|
ZEUS |  Afghan Hounds | 2020-03-05 |Spay/Neuter|
    
In the examples so far, we have followed a straight line through the tables so that each table added to the result set joins to the table that we previously joined.

```
 Breeds
  \
   Dogs
    \
     Events
      \
       Event_Types
```

However, it is possible to join a new table to any previous part of the result set.

```
 
       Dogs
      /  \
Breeds    Events
           \
            Event_Types
```

```SQL
SELECT TOP 5
Dogs.Dog_Name,
Breeds.Breed_Name,
Events.Date,
Event_Types.Description
FROM Dogs
INNER JOIN Events on Dogs.Breed_ID = Events.Breed_ID
INNER JOIN Event_Types on Events.Event_Type_ID = Event_Types.Event_Type_ID
INNER JOIN Breeds on Breeds.Breed_ID = Dogs.Breed_ID
```
    
It is also possible to reference the same table twice in the same query, effectively 'joining' the table back to itself. For example, suppose we wanted to match dogs with potential playmates of the same sex:

```SQL
SELECT TOP 5
Dogs.Dog_Name,
Second_Dog.Dog_Name as Playmate
FROM Dogs
INNER JOIN Dogs AS Second_Dog on Dogs.Sex = Second_Dog.Sex
WHERE Dogs.Dog_ID < Second_Dog.Dog_ID -- Makes sure each pair is unique
```

Dog_Name| Playmate|
:---:|:---:|
LUNA|    BELLA|
LUNA|    DAISY|
LUNA|     LUCY|
LUNA|   BAILEY|
LUNA|     NALA|

`AS` creates an alias or alternative name for the second reference to the same table, so the database knows which version of which column we want where.

## WHERE

The `WHERE` clause trims the result set we create in the `FROM` clause down to the rows we want to keep. The `WHERE` clause amounts to a long logical test applied to each row. If the result is true then the row is kept; otherwise it is removed from the result set.

For example, HFS received the following request:

> I want to adopt a senior dog for my family (at least 10 years old). We'd like a boy dog. We want him to be a mixed breed and our daughter wants a big dog. Like, really big, at least 70 pounds!

This translates to the following query:

```SQL
SELECT
Dogs.Dog_Name,
Breeds.Breed_Name,
Dogs.Sex,
Dogs.Weight
FROM Dogs
INNER JOIN Breeds on Dogs.Breed_ID = Breeds.Breed_ID
WHERE Breeds.Breed_Name = 'Mixed' 
and Dogs.Sex = 'Male' 
and Dogs.Weight > 70
```

which finds this result:

Dog_Name | Breed_Name |Sex  |Weight| Age_At_Intake
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
LINCOLN  |Mixed| Male      |     74       | 15
 

**Boolean Operators** 

The following operators compare two values and test for equality or inequality:

Operator | Use 
|:---:|:---
= | Equal to
<> | Not Equal to
< | Less Than
<= | Less Than or Equal to
\> | Greater Than
\>= | Greater Than or Equal to

Inequalities between numeric values are conducted as most people would expect.
*  `3 < 10` is true
*  `10 < 3` is false

However, text values can also be compared as inequalities, using lexical (dictionary) ordering, meaning < and > test whether the first value is alphabetically before or after the second value.
* `"a" < "z"` is true
* `"dogs" > "cats"` is true
* `"3" < "10"` is false, because `"3"` and `"10"` are treated as text (strings of characters), and "3" comes 'alphabetically' after "1"

This leads into another feature that surprises a lot of people: dates are formatted as YYYY-MM-DD, or year-month-day. For example:
* December 7, 1941 is `1941-12-07`
* The earliest date that can be represented is often [January 1, 1753](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3310569/what-is-the-significance-of-1-1-1753-in-sql-server), or `1753-01-01`
* The latest date that can be represented is often December 31, 9999, or `9999-12-31`

A benefit here is that dates can be represented as strings and compared in dictionary order.
* `2022-09-19` is before `2023-01-01` both chronologically and alphabetically, but `09/19/2022` would not be alphabetically before '01/01/2023'

**Negation:** A `NOT` before a logical test also negates the test, so `1 <> 2` is equivalent to `NOT (1 = 2)`

**Null:** Boolean tests return NULL when any value is compared to NULL, so use `ISNULL` to supply a default value. For example `ISNULL(Breed, '')` would give the breed for each dog, but if a dog's breed is not known, it will insert an empty string (the emptiness between the two quotation marks), and we can test whether `ISNULL(Breed, '') = 'Xoloitzcuintli'`.

We can **combine comparisons** using `AND` and `OR`. 
* Two comparisons combined with `AND` will result in true if both comparisons are true; otherwise it is false. 
* Two comparisons combined with `OR` will result in true if either the first or the second is true, or if both are true.

Using `OR` can be tricky, though. Consider the following request:

> I want to find a pure-bred dog (no mixed breeds, please) for my grandmother. She's a little unsteady on her feet and we're worried about a large or energetic dog knocking her over, so we'd like to find one less than 10 pounds or more than 10 years old.

We write the following query:

```sql
SELECT TOP 10
Dogs.Dog_Name,
Breeds.Breed_Name,
Dogs.Sex,
Dogs.Weight
FROM Dogs
INNER JOIN Breeds on Dogs.Breed_ID = Breeds.Breed_ID
WHERE 
Breeds.Breed_name <> 'Mixed' 
and Dogs.Weight < 10 
or Dogs.Age_at_Intake > 10
```
with this result:

Dog_Name|Breed_Name|Sex|Weight
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
DAISY|                        Pointers| Female|    50
NALA|                        Shih Tzu| Female|     8
ELLIE|                        Harriers| Female|    52
SADIE|                     Schipperkes| Female|    11
RUBY|                        Shih Tzu| Female|    13
<span style="color:blue">ROSIE|                           Mixed| Female|    15</span>
LOLA|                        Samoyeds| Female|    46
COCO|             Miniature Pinschers| Female|     9
HARLEY|                      Chow Chows| Female|    63
ROXY| American Staffordshire Terriers| Female|    40
    
Now hold on a minute! Rosie the mutt made it onto this list (right in the middle of the result), even though we specifically asked for mixed breeds to be excluded with `Breeds.Breed_Name <> 'Mixed'`! What happened?

To find out, let's take a look back at the `WHERE` clause we wrote:

``` sql
WHERE 
Breeds.Breed_name <> 'Mixed' 
and Dogs.Weight < 10 
or Dogs.Age_at_Intake > 10
```

We actually asked for a dog to be included if it met one of two criteria: either it is a small pure-bred (`Breeds.Breed_name <> 'Mixed' and Dogs.Weight < 10`) or it is an older dog, regardless of breed. We can clarify what we wanted by adding parentheses to group the comparisons and to make sure the `OR` comparison comes first.

``` sql
WHERE 
Breeds.Breed_name <> 'Mixed' 
(and Dogs.Weight < 10 
or Dogs.Age_at_Intake > 10)
```
